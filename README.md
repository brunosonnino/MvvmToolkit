# MVVM Toolkit

These are the projects shown in the talk _The MVVM Pattern and the MVVM Community toolkit_

There are two folders in the repository, __MVVMApp__ and __MVVMMessenger__

The __MVVMApp__ folder contains the project that was converted to use the MVVM Pattern, with to folders:

* _CustomerApp - Original_ - this is the original WPF app, not using the MVVM Pattern
* _CustomerApp - Final_ - this is the converted app, using the Community toolkit version 8

The __MVVMMessenger__ folder contains the project that has two different windows, with the Navigation Service and using the Messenger to communicate between them

Both projects contain tests for the ViewModels and they use FakeItEasy for mocking and FluentAssertions
